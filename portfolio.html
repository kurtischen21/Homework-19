    <h3 class="concept">Concept</h3>
    <p class="conceptParagraph">Embark was a case study that was meant to showcase a new and exciting travel feature. The idea behind this case study was to not only present a refreshing and fun travel experience, but to also create user flow that guided users to the feature. In order to do this, I was tasked with completing user interviews, gathering survey data, and creating wireframes.</p>

    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>The need for this case study arose from gathering and synthesizing user data. After discovering user pain points and what users wished they could improve about their current method of traveling, I decided to create a travel app called Embark. Embark wasn’t meant to re-invent the wheel, but rather take what is already working and improving what is out there by listening to users and utilizing empathy to understand what other users were going through.</p>

  <div class="media-body">
    <h3 class="concept">Process</h3>
    <p>The process began with creating interview questions and survey questions. During this time a proto-persona was created, a rough idea of what a typical user Embark would look like. After the data was gathered, I synthesized the information to create a more accurate representation	of an Embark user and created an actual persona.</p>

    <p>After a persona was established, I proceeded to create very rough wireframes on paper to get an idea of what the app would look and flow like. Again, Embark wasn’t meant to re-invent anything, but rather taking what people were already familiar with by borrowing established UI elements such as the floating navigation bar similar to Pinterest, as well as cards that Airbnb use on their app.</p><br><br><br>

    <h3 class="concept">Discovery</h3>
    <p>Once the wireframes were roughly sketched out, I translated them into Adobe XD for more fidelity. At this point, the app was slowly developing and was ready for a quick test. After a decent amount of people tested, I took the information and began to re-iterate on the prototype. The user testing provided me with significant insight on what I overlooked, often times little things that I didn’t consider like a back button for example. Many of my users were running into dead-ends.</p>

    <p>This process was essentially always something that was always growing and changing. Iterating and re-iterating was something I didn't quite understand in the beginning of this class, but after this case study I realized how important this part of the process was.</p><br><br><br>

    <p>After taking user feedback, advice, and suggestions, I was ready to proceed with a hi-fidelity prototype. Once I applied typography and imagery, it was time again for more user testing. As mentioned in the previous section, testing was something I was constantly doing every time I made significant changes.<br><br>
  
      The main objective was to create a user flow that helped guide users to the new feature Embark presented and after much testing, a majority of the users felt that it made sense and that the navigation was easy. The main objective of Embark was to help users ensure that were getting the best possible price for a hotel room by comparing other hotels and lodging websites. Embark aimed to address the common user pain point in my user data, which was the uncertainty that people were getting the best deal for their money.</p>
